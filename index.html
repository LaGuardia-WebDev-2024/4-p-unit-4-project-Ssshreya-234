  <h1>A guide to my favortie South asian places to eat in New York City</h1>
  
  <h3 class="Spice-Symphony">Spice Symphony</h3>
  <hr>
  <p class="Spice-Symphony">
    Located at E 50th St In Manhattan and in Times Square<br>
    Spice Symphony is a Indian restaurant that also serves Chinese dishes. <br>
    The Indian food here is probably one of the best in the city in my opinion. <br>
    It has great vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian options.
  </p>

  <h3 class="The-Kati-Roll-Company">The Kati Roll Company</h3>
  <hr>
  <p class="The-Kati-Roll-Company">
  This has multiple locations throughout the city. <br>
  A Kati Roll is basically a burrito that is wrapped with Paratha or Roti and filled with different types of meat, potatoes, or panner. I really like the different options this restaurant has as well as the overall ambience of the whole place. There is always old bollywood songs playing while the walls are covered with different Indian magazines and posters. They also offer Indian Chai which is reallyy good.
